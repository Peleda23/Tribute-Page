      <ul>
        <li>Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth and in space.
        </li>
        <li>His automaker, Tesla Motors, which was founded in 2003, is bringing fully-electric vehicles to the mass
          market.</li>
        <li>He settled with the SEC in September 2018 for making alleged "false statements" about a plan to take Tesla
          private, and had to step down as chairman.</li>
        <li>SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is now valued at more than $20 billion.</li>
        <li>He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He landed in the US as a transfer student
          at the University of Pennsylvania.</li>

      <p>"There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live?
        What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being
        out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing."
